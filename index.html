    <p>Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power <br>
        lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's<br>
        take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON <br>
        traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather <br>
        like as we approach the equator?"
        aliqua. <br></p>
